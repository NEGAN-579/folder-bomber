# folder-bomber

this tool is very easy but danger! If you are a novice programmer and want to write a simple but high-performance tool, this tool is a good example for practicing and expanding your programming knowledge.

You can also upgrade this tool and add other features to it!

> notice1:

nothing abuse of this program is not related to the developer!

# :wrench: about this tool:

This tool can create folders until the target system slows down.

# :world_map: how to use this tool?!

- you should download "folder bomber.py" from my github account.
- install rand-string library with `python3 pip install rand-string` or `python install rand-string` or `pip install rand-string` syntaxes in cmd or terminal.
- then, open "folder nomber.py" file with vscode or notpad++ or...
- now you should write the path that you want to create folders in it.
- if you want just to watch how the tool works, don't clear the hashes (#)!
- lines of 13 and 14 is very danger and i recommend do not run that part of code in any systems!

# future:
